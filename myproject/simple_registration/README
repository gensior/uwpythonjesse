Version 0.1  Use at own risk.

How to install.

1.  Copy simple_registration to project.  My-Project/simple_registration.

2.  Add 'simple_registration', to installed apps. 

3.  Make sure the 'django.template.loaders.app_directories.load_template_source', template loader is installed.  Restart your server so the /simple_registration/templates/simple_registration/ directory will be found as a loading source for templates. 

4.  Add (r'^accounts/', include('simple_registration.urls')), to base urls file.  NB do not add a namespace to this include, auth url reverse features break if you attempt to namespace them.
